# kinematic-dynamic-analysis
Current repository includes MATLAB files related to the kinematic and dynamic analysis of Kinova Jaco<sup>2</sup> 6 DOF robotic arm. Α PD controller scheme is, also, included so as to test the behavior of the computed dynamic model.

The appropriate kinematic parameters and other technical specifications of Jaco<sup>2</sup> 6 DOF can be found within the datasheet `JACO²-6DOF-Advanced-Specification-Guide.pdf`. Other useful information relative to j2n6s300 (an abbreviation that refers to the model Jaco<sup>2</sup> 6 DOF with 3 robot fingers) model was extracted from [Github kinova-ros package](https://github.com/Kinovarobotics/kinova-ros).

## MATLAB vesrion
The version of MATLAB used to develop this project is R2015a.

## File system
The main files of the current repository are the following:
- `kinematic_analysis_j2n6s300.m` file contains the kinematic analysis of Jaco<sup>2</sup>
- `dynamic_analysis_j2n6s300.m` file contains the dynamic analysis of Jaco<sup>2</sup>
- `pd_controller_j2n6s300.slx` file consists the Simulink PD controller scheme of Jaco<sup>2</sup>

All the other files constitute functions, either autogenerated from MATLAB or not that are used within the above mentioned three main files:
- `DH.m` function for the extraction of DH matrix of a joint, given the classic DH parameters of that joint
- `inertialParams.m` function that returns a struct with inertial parameters of Kinova Jaco<sup>2</sup> obtained from [Github kinova-ros package](https://github.com/Kinovarobotics/kinova-ros)
- `cor_centriTerms.m` autogenerated function that contains the coriolis and centrifugal terms of dynamic analysis
- `gravityVector.m` autogenerated function that contains the gravity vector of dynamic analysis
- `inertialMatrix.m` autogenerated function that contains the inertial matrix of dynamic analysis
- `eom.m` function that returns joint accelerations dqq by solving the forward dynamics equation

## Execution
In order to execute any of the main files you should use the Run command. Especially, the `dynamic_analysis_j2n6s300.m` file has as a prerequisity the execution of `kinematic_analysis_j2n6s300.m`. However, this requirement is covered by including the command `run('kinematic_analysis_j2n6s300')` in dynamic analysis' script.
